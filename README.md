# Vehicle Insurance cross sell prediction
### version 24-06-2021
## Description
An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.

Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year a client needs to pay a premium of a certain amount to the insurance provider company so that in case of an unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‘sum assured’) to the customer. Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

> Objective to this project is to be able to build and evaluate the performances of different classification algorithms that can help us predict whether or not a client will be interested in vehicle insurance.
